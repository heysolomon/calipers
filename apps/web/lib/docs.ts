    description: 'Hover to see an element’s size; click to see its typography, colours, and box values.',
    content: `
# Inspect Mode

Inspect mode is the default when you activate Calipers. Hover to see what is under the cursor, click to see everything about it — without opening DevTools.

## How it works

1. Activate Calipers (\`Cmd+Shift+M\`).
2. Hover over the page. Elements are outlined and labelled with \`width × height\`; words of text are highlighted.
3. Click an element or a word to open its details.
4. Click it again, click empty space, or press \`Esc\` to close the details.

## The details panel

The panel opens next to what you clicked, with the tag and size at the top and one section open at a time:

- **Typography** (when you click text) — font, size, weight, line height, and letter spacing, with a **Copy CSS** button.
- **Colours** — text, background, and border colours in HEX, RGB, or HSL. Press \`F\` to cycle the format.
- **Box** — margin, border, padding, and corner radius.

Click any value to copy it. A closed section previews its contents in its header.

## Rulers

Enable **Rulers** in the options card, or press \`R\`, to show pixel rulers along the viewport edges.
    `.trim(),
  },

  'features/measure-mode': {
    title: 'Measure Mode',
    description: 'Click elements to measure pixel distance between their closest edges. Pin up to five elements at once.',
    content: `
# Measure Mode

Measure mode lets you click elements to see the pixel distance between their closest edges, with dimension lines and labels drawn on the canvas overlay.

## How it works

1. Switch to Measure mode — press \`2\` or select **Measure** in the control panel.
2. Click the **first element** — it stays highlighted and labelled **A**.
3. Click the **second element** — the gap between them is measured and labelled **B**.
4. Keep clicking to pin up to **five elements** (A through E). Every consecutive pair is measured simultaneously.
5. Click a pinned element again to unpin just that one. Press \`Cmd+Z\` / \`Ctrl+Z\` to undo.

## Smart edge detection

Calipers automatically finds the closest edges between two elements:

- Side-by-side elements → horizontal gap (right edge to left edge)
- Stacked elements → vertical gap (bottom edge to top edge)

Alignment guidelines are drawn when edges line up horizontally or vertically.

## Multi-element measurement

Pin three or more elements to compare a whole row or column at once. Each consecutive pair gets its own measurement line and label — useful for checking consistent spacing across a toolbar, card grid, or nav items.

## Copying measurements

Click any distance label to copy the value to your clipboard (e.g. \`24px\`).

  },

  'features/guides': {
    title: 'Alignment Guides',
    description: 'Place draggable horizontal and vertical guides with snap-to-element-edge support.',
    content: `
# Alignment Guides

Alignment guides are persistent horizontal and vertical lines you can place anywhere on the page to check alignment against your layout.

## Placing guides

1. Switch to Guides mode — press \`3\`.
2. Move the crosshair to the position you want.
3. Click anywhere on the page (outside the ruler strip) to drop a **horizontal and vertical guide** at that point.

## Moving guides

Drag a guide to reposition it. With **Snap to elements** enabled, both the placement preview and a guide being dragged snap to nearby element edges within 8px, and to elements you have pinned in Measure or marked in Annotate. A click places the guide exactly where the preview line is showing.

## Removing guides

Hover a guide and the cursor changes to a delete mark.

- **Click** the guide to remove it.
- Press **Del** or **Backspace** over a guide to remove it, or away from one to clear all guides.
- Press \`Cmd+Z\` / \`Ctrl+Z\` to undo adding, moving, deleting, or clearing.

## Persistence

Guides belong to the page they were placed on. Each page (site and path) keeps its own guides in \`chrome.storage.local\`, so guides from one site or page never appear on another. They survive mode switches and reopening Calipers.

Toggle **Show guides** in the options card to hide guides without deleting them.

  'features/color-picker': {
    title: 'Colours & Typography',
    description: 'Read the colours and type settings of anything on the page from Inspect mode.',
    content: `
# Colours & Typography

Colours and typography are part of [Inspect mode](/docs/features/inspect-mode). There is no separate colour picker mode.

## How it works

1. In Inspect mode, click a word of text or an element.
2. Open the **Typography** or **Colours** section in the details panel.
3. Click any value to copy it.

## Colour formats

Switch between three formats in the Colours section, or press \`F\`:

- **HEX** — \`#4A9EFF\` or \`#4A9EFF80\` with alpha
- **RGB** — \`rgb(74, 158, 255)\` or \`rgba(74, 158, 255, 0.5)\`
- **HSL** — \`hsl(210, 100%, 65%)\`

## Typography

Clicking text shows the font, size, weight, line height, and letter spacing. **Copy CSS** copies them all as CSS declarations, including the text colour.

Values are read from \`window.getComputedStyle()\`, so they reflect what is rendered. The font shown is the first family in the CSS font stack.

  'features/annotate': {
    title: 'Annotate',
    description: 'Mark up a page with size callouts, notes, arrows, and freehand strokes.',
    content: `
# Annotate

Annotate mode lets you mark up the page you are looking at, then capture it with a screenshot.

## Tools

Switch to Annotate mode with \`4\`, then pick a tool in the options card or by key:

- **Size** (\`M\`) — click an element to add its width and height.
- **Note** (\`N\`) — click to write a note.
- **Arrow** (\`A\`) — drag to draw an arrow.
- **Pen** (\`P\`) — draw freehand.

## Editing

- Right-click an annotation to remove it.
- \`Del\` / \`Backspace\` clears all annotations.
- \`Cmd+Z\` / \`Ctrl+Z\` undoes the last change.

Annotations stay with the page they were made on and last until the page is reloaded.

    description: 'Read the margin, border, padding, and corner radius of any element.',
    content: `
# Box Values

Box values are part of [Inspect mode](/docs/features/inspect-mode).

## How it works

1. In Inspect mode, click an element.
2. Open the **Box** section in the details panel.
3. Click a value to copy it.

Margin, border, and padding are shown in CSS shorthand order (top, right, bottom, left), shortened where sides match. Values come from \`window.getComputedStyle()\`, so they reflect the rendered layout.

  'features/rulers': {

    content: `
# Ruler Overlay

The ruler overlay adds pixel rulers along the top and left viewport edges, with a crosshair tracking your cursor position — similar to ruler guides in design tools.

## Enabling

Toggle **Rulers** in the control panel. Rulers are available in every mode.

## What you see

- Pixel tick marks along the top and left edges of the viewport
- A horizontal and vertical crosshair line following your cursor
- A position label showing \`x, y\` coordinates

In Guides mode, the crosshair also previews where guides will be placed when you click.

    content: `
# Design Tokens

The design token panel reads all CSS custom properties (\`--*\` variables) defined on the page and lets you export them as JSON.

## Opening the panel

Press \`D\` while Calipers is active, or click **Tokens** in the control panel.

## What it shows

Each token displays:

- **Name** — the custom property name (e.g. \`--color-primary\`)
- **Value** — the computed value
- **Type** — colour, spacing, typography, or other (classified automatically)

## Exporting

Click **Copy JSON** to copy all tokens as a JSON object to your clipboard — ready to paste into a design system file, Figma tokens plugin, or codebase.

## Click to copy

Click any individual token row to copy that single \`name: value\` pair.

    content: `
# Screenshot Export

Export the current viewport as a PNG with all Calipers measurements, guides, and overlays baked in.

## How to export

Press \`S\` while Calipers is active. The extension captures the visible tab via \`chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab()\` and triggers a download.

The file is saved as \`calipers-{timestamp}.png\`.

## What is included

The screenshot includes what you have drawn — dimension labels, measurement lines, guides, annotations, and rulers. The Calipers toolbar, cursor, and notifications are hidden while the capture is taken.

## Tips

- Position your measurements before exporting — the capture is instant.
- Use screenshot exports to attach spacing checks to PRs, design reviews, or bug reports.
