## What is Raval?

Raval is a free, open-source Chrome extension that lets designers and developers instantly measure distances, inspect dimensions, and check alignment on any webpage. Think PixelSnap, but for the browser — with direct DOM access for pixel-perfect accuracy.

Activate it with `⌥⇧C` (`Alt+Shift+C`), hover over any element, and immediately see its exact size. No screenshots. No switching apps.

---

## Features

- **Inspect mode** — hover over elements to see `width × height` in a floating label
- **Measure mode** — click two elements and see the pixel distance between their closest edges
- **Alignment guides** — drag horizontal and vertical guide lines anywhere on the page
- **Box model overlay** — colour-coded margin, padding, border, and content visualisation
- **Screenshot export** — capture the viewport with measurements overlaid, saved as PNG
- **Keyboard-first** — every action has a shortcut; no mouse required
